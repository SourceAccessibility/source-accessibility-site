    <h1>Welcome to Source Accessibility</h1>
    <p>
At Source Accessibility, we believe everyone should have the same opportunity to access and navigate digital services—regardless of ability, device, or circumstance.

It’s not just permanent disabilities that impact digital journeys. Situational and temporary barriers—like a broken arm, poor internet connection, glare on a screen, or holding a baby—can affect how people interact with your product too.

We help businesses design and deliver accessible, inclusive digital experiences that meet the needs of all users. Our services add value not just for your customers, but for your teams as well—supporting a “shift-left” approach that embeds accessibility and user-centred design across your organisation.

We provide:
	•	Accessibility strategy and consulting
	•	Inclusive user research with disabled testers with lived experience
	•	Manual accessibility testing and auditing
	•	Disability awareness training and workshops
	•	Support across the full product lifecycle

All our work aligns with key compliance frameworks like the European Accessibility Act (EAA), EN 301 549, and WCAG.

By adopting an inclusive mindset, we help you reflect the real ways people interact with your designs—and remove barriers before they block anyone’s path.    </p>
