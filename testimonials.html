        <p>
          “Marie is an invaluable accessibility consultant to Skyscanner, supporting us primarily with inclusive user testing. Her technical background and genuine passion for accessibility makes a real impact on how we design and build for disabled users.
          
          Marie has created a robust user testing framework for our Partner Programme, carried out extensive manual audits, built a trusted panel of disabled testers, and works directly with our engineering teams to plan and facilitate high-quality inclusive user testing sessions.

          She’s hard working, flexible, and a pleasure to work with – a true asset to any team!”
